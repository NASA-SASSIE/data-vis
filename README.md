# Welcome to SASSIE Data Visualization Github! 

<p>Thank you for you interest in the SASSIE campaign data!</p>
    <p>SASSIE is a NASA funded project that aims to better understand the role of salinity stratification in the marginal ice zone. In the fall of 2022, SASSIE conducted a field campaign off the Alaskan coast in the Beaufort Sea. This campaign included shipboard measurements as well as 6 remotely piloted/drifing platforms and an ariel campaign.

## Here you will find Jupyter Notebooks that show ways to download and visualize data collected durring the SASSIE campaign. 
 <p>The aim of this notebook is to assist the end user in exploratory data analysis by downloading the SASSIE Data from NASA's PODAAC, opening the datasets and displaying their associated metadata, and creating a few visualizations that can be saved to the user's local disc. Please use the following sections to explore this data. The blocks of code must be run in order for full functionality, even if they are in different sections. This notebook was created by Elizabeth Westbrook. For questions and trouble shooting, please email westbrooke@uncw.edu.</p>

<b> The notebooks are accessible through a Jupyter binder. Please visit <a href = "https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/NASA-SASSIE/data-vis/main">https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/NASA-SASSIE/data-vis/main</a></b>
